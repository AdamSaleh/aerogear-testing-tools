= Arquillian Rule

Arquillian Rule Extension allows you to inject a JUnit MethodRule into test. This rule has a few advantages when compared to basic JUnit rule:

1. It is executed in Arquillian lifecycle, encapsulating Test event.
2. Its fields are automatically injected
3. You can modify tests to run multiple times with this rule

== Usage

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(ArquillianRules.class)
public class MyTest {

    @ArquillianRule
    public MethodRule rule = new MyMethodRuleImpl();

    @Test
    public void test() {
    }
}
----

Rule is always executed using around-invoke for test method. So its lifecycle is very similar to  +@Before+ and +@After+ method.
If you rather want to executed rule in +@BeforeClass+ and +@AfterClass+ manner, make rule +static+ and implement a check whether rule was already executed.
